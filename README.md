# NYC Bikesharing
# Overview
By performing this analysis of the CitiBike bikesharing program in NYC, we are aiming to see if a similar program can be implemented in Des Moines, Iowa and see the same amount level of success. By providing potential investors with data visualizations created in Tableau, we are hoping to gain their approval to create a new bikesharing program and that it is worth investing in. 

# Results

## Checkout Times by Gender

The Checkout Times by Gender graph shows as similar trend to the first graph. Most rides were around the 20 minute or less mark regardless of the gender of the user. This graph also shows that men are using the bikesharing program approximately three times more than females. 


## Trips by Weekday per Hour

The Trips by Weekday per Hour heatmap shows that during the weekdays, most users are utilizing the bikes between 7am and 9am and in the evenings from 5pm-7pm. During the weekend, the most popular times are between the hours of 12pm-3pm.

This heatmap shows a similar pattern by gender as the Trips by Weekday per Hour heatmap. Both men and women seem to be using the bikes most often from 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm during the weekdays. We can also see from this heatmap that males are using the bikes more often throughout the week than females. 


## User Trips by Gender by Weekday

According to the User Trips by Gender by Weekday heatmap, regardless of the day of the week, males are using the bikes more often and the majority of male and female riders are subscribers to the program. The usage of bikes by customers rather than subscribers is more evenly distributed among male, female, and unknown users. 


## Top Starting Locations

The Top Starting Locations map shows that the most popular locations for users to begin their bike ride are in high traffic areas of NYC such as along the Hudson River, around the Empire State Building, and around Rockefeller Center. These are major tourist attractions in NYC and provide a great starting point for users looking to explore.
