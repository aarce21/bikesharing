# bikesharing
# Overview
By performing this analysis of the CitiBike bikesharing program in NYC, we are aiming to see if a similar program can be implemented in Des Moines, Iowa and see the same amount level of success. By providing potential investors with data visualizations created in Tableau, we are hoping to gain their approval to create a new bikesharing program and that it is worth investing in.
