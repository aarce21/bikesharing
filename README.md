# NYC Bikesharing
# Overview
By performing this analysis of the CitiBike bikesharing program in NYC, we are aiming to see if a similar program can be implemented in Des Moines, Iowa and see the same amount level of success. By providing potential investors with data visualizations created in Tableau, we are hoping to gain their approval to create a new bikesharing program and that it is worth investing in. 

# Results
## Checkout Times for Users

According to the checkout times for users graph, the majority of rides seem to be around 20 minutes or less and nearly all rides are less than one hour. 


## Checkout Times by Gender

The Checkout Times by Gender graph shows as similar trend to the first graph. Most rides were around the 20 minute or less mark regardless of the gender of the user. This graph also shows that men are using the bikesharing program approximately three times more than females. 


## Trips by Weekday per Hour

The Trips by Weekday per Hour heatmap shows that during the weekdays, most users are utilizing the bikes between 7am and 9am and in the evenings from 5pm-7pm. During the weekend, the most popular times are between the hours of 12pm-3pm. 


## Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

This heatmap shows a similar pattern by gender as the Trips by Weekday per Hour heatmap. Both men and women seem to be using the bikes most often from 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm during the weekdays. We can also see from this heatmap that males are using the bikes more often throughout the week than females. 


## User Trips by Gender by Weekday

According to the User Trips by Gender by Weekday heatmap, regardless of the day of the week, males are using the bikes more often and the majority of male and female riders are subscribers to the program. The usage of bikes by customers rather than subscribers is more evenly distributed among male, female, and unknown users. 


## Top Starting Locations

The Top Starting Locations map shows that the most popular locations for users to begin their bike ride are in high traffic areas of NYC such as along the Hudson River, around the Empire State Building, and around Rockefeller Center. These are major tourist attractions in NYC and provide a great starting point for users looking to explore. 


## Gender Breakdown
![genderbreakdown](https://github.com/aarce21/bikesharing/blob/main/images/genderbreakdown.PNG)

The bikesharing program in NYC is predominantly used by males, almost 70% of users are male. Females account for about 25% of users in the program. 

# Summary
The NYC Bikesharing program has shown to be highly successful in an area with high tourist and commuter traffic. With the analysis we performed we were able to see the breakdown of users by gender and type, what times of day and days of the week were most popular for users, the length of time bikes are being used on average, and which locaitons in NYC were more popular to checkout a bike than others. With the amount of insight gleaned into the program, a similar program has the potential to see great success in a city such as Des Moines, Iowa, where there are numerous attracitons and activites for users. 

To gain more insight into the bikesharing program in NYC further analysis is necessary. It would be helpful to perform an analysis of the program in various months throughout the year instead of just focusing on August. This could help us see what months or seasons out of the year are more successful and when the bikes are utilized most often. We can also perform an analysis that looks at checkout times and the age groups of the bike riders. This wil help us see if there is a strong correlation between a users age and the length of time they use a bike.
